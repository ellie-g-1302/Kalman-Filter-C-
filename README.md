Implementation of a Kalman Filter into the Avionics bay for Rocket Propulsion Lab at Saint Louis University

# About
For the International Rocket Engineering Competition 2025. The actual algorithm is fully made and usuable but we weren't able to use it in the competition due to not having enough time to fine tune the state model. Kalman filters work by inputting an initial value for the state estimate and covariance matrix, and also four matrices A, H, Q, R. These are the state transition matrix, state-to-measurement matrix, process noise matrix, and measurement covariance matix respectively (these also might have different names in various literature). The purpose of this code is so that students in RPL (or anyone else) who wants to use a Kalman Filter in C++ can have the algorithm already written and focus solely on the state model, as this requires thorough knowledge of the dynamics of your system, some mathematics and statistics, and a crude understanding of control theory. Any questions can be sent to emcghee2@ur.rochester.edu
